# TecheCommerce
ASP.NET MVC 5
The project we'll create is for the TecheCommerce, a fictitious ione stop store for all your tech needs. 
Create a new e-commerce site where they can sell their products online, and we've selected ASP.NET MVC 5 for the project. 
There may be a Data folder and a Code folder. 
The Code folder will contain the code files for the project and later in the course the data folder will contain a .bak file, which is a SQL Server database backup file that you can use to create your own database.
